what the following code would print?
int main(void)
{
  printf("Hello, World);
}

"hello, world", right?

Now if we were to compile this from C to machine code, to binary,
we'd have a few steps along the way.

first step to assembly code, this kind of esoteric language here that isn't quite binary,
but is almost there.
And in the next step, we end up getting down to this binary
that your computer actually runs.
